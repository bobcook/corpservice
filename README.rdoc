== README

I am running out of time to get this project running.

The application keeps track of workorders.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.0.0p247

* System dependencies rails 4 - not much else.

* Database SQlite3

* How to run the test suite - just run rake

* There are 4 nested databases;
  Clients
  Locations
  Franchises
  Workorders
  
  The application is already able to add Clients and Locations.  I need to be able to add franchises and workorders.
